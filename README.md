# Project-1-Portfolio

The technologies that i used were jquery and javascript to to make a nav bar that sticks to the top of the page once you start scrolling down. 

inside of that nav bar i have links that can take you to a certain id in the html on the page that used jquery. and i added a smooth slide down effect instead of just skipping down directly to th spot

i added modal buttons on my proect divs that open up a modal where i can display additional info on each project i decide to put inside of the divs. they are currently blank.

i added an accordian that opens up and shares some of the things i find interesting and things that i want to learn in the future. 

each section uses @media to resize based on the dimensions that it is used from so it looks ok from smarthpone to full desktop.

my resume section is bleak but i look forward to adding new things onto that like general assembly graduate and future companies i work for down the road. 


i did this project piece by pice i and made sure each section was built for all screen sizes before moving onto the next. i wanted it to bevery simple and smooth with light colors.

unsolved problem with my accordian widths at when i try to make them a set % or Px they dont seem to match so ill have to play with that for a bit.
